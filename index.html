            <h2>MICHAEL JACKSON: THE LEGACY LIVES ON</h2>
            <p class="lead-paragraph">
                The undisputed **King of Pop**, Michael Jackson's influence transcends generations, making him one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His groundbreaking music, iconic dance moves, and unparalleled showmanship reshaped the music industry forever.
            </p>

            <p>
                From his early days as the youngest member of the **Jackson 5** to his solo dominance with albums like *Thriller* (the best-selling album of all time), Jackson consistently pushed the boundaries of artistry. His music videos, such as *Thriller*, *Billie Jean*, and *Smooth Criminal*, were cinematic masterpieces, turning the music video format into a crucial marketing and artistic tool. His signature style, including the single white glove, military jackets, and the famous **moonwalk** (лунная походка), are instantly recognizable worldwide.

            <p>
                Beyond the stage, Jackson was also a dedicated humanitarian. His song *Man in the Mirror* and his support for various charities highlighted his commitment to global causes. Despite the controversies that shadowed his later life, his musical genius remains undeniable, celebrated by millions of fans globally. His work continues to inspire new artists, confirming his eternal status as a pop icon.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jackson's innovative approach to sound and visuals is still studied today. He perfectly blended genres—from **R&B** and **Funk** to **Pop** and **Rock**—creating a unique sound palette. The raw energy of his live performances set a standard that few have ever reached, cementing his legend in the history books.
